  <h2>1.Encapsulation</h2>
  <br>
  <p>The process of binding data and corresponding methods (behavior) together into a single unit is called encapsulation in Java.

  In other words, encapsulation is a programming technique that binds the class members (variables and methods) together and prevents them from being accessed by other classes. Thereby, we can keep variables and methods safes from outside interference and misuse.
  
  Every Java class is an example of encapsulation because we write everything within the class only that binds variables and methods together and hides their complexity from other classes. Another example of encapsulation is a capsule. Basically, capsule encapsulates several combinations of medicine.
  
  If combinations of medicine are variables and methods then the capsule will act as a class and the whole process is called Encapsulation as shown in the below figure.

  <h4>Realtime Example: </h4>
  <p>
    When you log in your email accounts such as Gmail, or Yahoo Mail, there is a lot of internal processes taking place in the backend and you have no control over it.
  </p>
  <br>
  <P>When you enter the password for logging, they are retrieved in an encrypted form and verified, and then you are given access to your account.
 </P>
 <br>
 <pr>You do not have control over it that how the password has been verified. Thus, it keeps our account safe from being misused.

  <h2>2.Inheritance
  </h2>
  <br>
  <pr>
    Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).
  </pr>

  <p>
    The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.
